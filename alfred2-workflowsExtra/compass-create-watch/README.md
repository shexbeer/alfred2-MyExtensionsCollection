**Create a [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) project and watch it immediately.**

Compass Create Watch will create the Compass project, open the Terminal and the project directory in the Finder so you can start coding straight away.

Runs either by using keyword ("ccw") in your currently open Finder directory, or as a file/folder action:

To create a Compass project without Compass watching it immediately, you can use the "nowatch" argument in addition when triggering by keyword:

Obviously, it requires [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) to be installed.
